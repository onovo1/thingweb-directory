# thingweb-directory

The Thingweb Directory is an open source directory for Thing Descriptions. The [Thing Description (TD) model](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) is a proposal of W3C Web of Things working group to describe Things.
The directory features an API to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a TD. The directory can be used to *browse* and *discover* Things based on their TDs. This functionality includes but is not limited to following cases:

  - Searching for a Thing based on its metadata, properties, actions or events;
  - Creating a new Thing's TD or updating an existing one;
  - Deleting a Thing's TD;
  - CRUD operations are supported either over HTTP or CoAP;
  - Generating a servient based on a discovered Thing.

### Building

* We are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build tool
* The application is built using the [Gradle Application Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html)

### Running the Directory

Download the project and build it (see [Building](#Building). Once it is finished, the server can be started:
```sh
$ java -jar thingweb-directory.jar <thingweb_directory_path>
```
`<thingweb-directory_path>` specifies the chosen location where the Directory is installed. After this step, the Directory server is running and can be accessed over HTTP from:
```sh
http://<thingweb_directory_ip>:8080/td
```
or over CoAP from:
```sh
coap://<thingweb_directory_ip>:5683/td
```

### Interacting with the Directory

###### Creates (adds) a TD to a collection `/td` (e.g., a Thing registers itself).

```sh
Method: POST
URI Template: /td
Request Parameters:
  lt := Lifetime (optional). Lifetime of the registration in seconds. If not specified, a default value of 86400 (24 hours) is assumed.
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Payload: content of a TD.jsonld file
Success: 201 Created
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 415 TD does not have URI
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

If the response code is `201 Created`, the URI path of the created sub-resource is defined in the header field `Location` (for HTTP) or `Location-Path` (for CoAP). The path is relative to the root resource and follows the pattern `/td/{id}`, where `id` is an ID assigned by the directory for the uploaded Thing Description.

If the associated uris of the new TD are already in the dataset, the response code is `400 Bad Request`. This is done in order to avoid duplicated TDs in the dataset. To change an existing TD use PUT instead.

###### Returns a list of TDs based on a SPARQL query pattern (e.g., a client queries the directory for a TD with a specific Thing URI).

```sh
Method: GET
URI Template: /td
Request Parameters:
  query := SPARQL query encoded as URI.
  text := Boolean text search query.
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

Examples:

- SPARQL query pattern to return a TD with `coap://192.168.1.104/Fan` associated as its URI:
```sh
?Y <http://www.w3c.org/wot/td#hasMetadata> ?X . ?Z <http://www.w3c.org/wot/td#associatedUri> "coap://192.168.1.104/Fan" .
```
HTTP request with the SPARQL query encoded as URI:
```sh
http://localhost:8080/td?query=%3FY+<http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3c.org%2Fwot%2Ftd%23hasMetadata>+%3FX+.%3FZ+<http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3c.org%2Fwot%2Ftd%23associatedUri>++"coap%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.104%2FFan".
```

- SPARQL query pattern to return all TDs (not recommended if their is a large amount of TDs in the directory)
```sh
?X ?Y ?Z .
```

- Boolean text search query to return a TD with `location` in `room_4`:
```sh
"location AND room_4"
```

Other possible combinations: "word", "word1 AND word2", "word1 OR word2", etc.

The response is a JSON object (_but no valid JSON-LD document_). This JSON object should have the following form:
```sh
{
  "/td/{id}": {... Thing Description ...},
  "/td/{id}": {... Thing Description ...},
  ...
}
```

###### Returns a TD based on its `{id}` (e.g., a client queries the directory for a specific TD).

```sh
Method: GET
URI Template: /td/{id}
URI Template Parameter:   
  {id} := ID of a TD to fetch.
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 404 Not Found
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

Example:
```sh
http://localhost:8080/td/0d134768
```


###### Updates an existing TD.
```sh
Method: PUT
URI Template: /td/{id}
URI Template Parameter:   
  {id} := ID of a TD to be updated.
  lt := Lifetime of the registration in seconds. If not specified, a default value of 86400 (24 hours) is assumed.
Payload: content of a TD.jsonld file
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

If the update changes the associated uris and at least one of them is registered with another TD, then the response code is `400 Bad Request`. This is done in order to avoid duplicated TDs in the dataset.

###### Deletes an existing TD.
```sh
Method: DELETE
URI Template: /td/{id}
URI Template Parameter:   
  {id} := ID of a TD to be deleted
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

###### Discovers a TD based on different type of lookups
```sh
Method: GET
URI Template: /td-lookup/{ep,sem}
URI Template Parameter:   
  lookup-type := {ep, sem, rdf} (Mandatory). Used to select the kind of lookup to perform (endpoint or semantic). The first type is used to lookup TDâ€™s by endpoint. The second type is used to lookup based on SPARQL query or a full text search query. The third type is used to lookup the unit values of a given RDF property.
  ep := Endpoint name (Optional). Use for endpoint lookups. It is the name given to the TD on registration (see POST method), and returned in the response content. If not specified all TDs are listed, otherwise it is used as a filter. Ex.: /td/1a23bc.
  query := SPARQL query encoded as URI. Used for semantic lookups.
  text := Full text search query. Used for semantic lookups.
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

Examples:
- Lookup by endpoint name:
```sh
coap://localhost:8080/td-lookup/ep?ep=/td/1a23bc
```

- Lookup by SPARQL query (same value as in GET method):
```sh
coap://localhost:8080/td-lookup/sem?query=?X ?Y ?Z .
```

- Lookup by text query (same value as in GET method):
```sh
coap://localhost:8080/td-lookup/sem?text="word1 AND word2"
```

- Lookup by RDF property:
```sh
coap://localhost:8080/td-lookup/sem?rdf=http://example.org/lightBrightness
```
## Open API Specification

See `src/main/resources/api.json` for a formal specification of the Thing Directory API. This file is exposed by the server at `/api.json`. It can e.g. be processed by the [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) to render an online documentation. See the [Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) for more details.

#### Translations

Translations translates between two Thing Descriptions (TDs). TDs are the semantic representation of the information of a thing. However, different things have a limited understanding of the information represented in all the TDs. For this reason, a translation between TDs is needed. Thus, different things can interact and understand each other even though their TDs are different.
The translations do not have lifetime and stay permanently in the system.

This API can create,read, update and delete (CRUD) translations. The functionality includes but is not limited to following cases:

  - Searching for a specific Translation or listing all the translations in the database;
  - Creating a new Translation or updating an existing one;
  - Deleting a Translation;
  - Searching for the translations requested by things but not defined in the database;
  
###### Creates (adds) a Translation to a collection `/translate`.

```sh
Method: POST
URI Template: /translate
Request Parameters:
 source := Source TD (compulsory). The source TD of the translation.
 target := Target TD (compulsory). The target TD of the translation.
 rt := Resource (compulsory). The resource name of the TD that is translated. 
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Payload: content of a TD.jsonld file
Success: 201 Created
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

If the response code is `201 Created`, the URI path of the created sub-resource is defined in the header field `Location` (for HTTP) or `Location-Path` (for CoAP). The path is relative to the root resource and follows the pattern `/translate/{id}`, where `id` is an ID assigned by the repository for the uploaded Translation.

If the associated uris of the new TD are already in the dataset, the response code is `400 Bad Request`. This is done in order to avoid duplicated Translations in the dataset. To change an existing Translation use PUT instead.

###### Updates an existing Translation.

```sh
Method: PUT
URI Template: /translate/{id}
URI Template Parameter:   
  {id} := ID of a Translation to be updated.
Payload: content of a TD.jsonld file
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

###### Deletes an existing Translation.

```sh
Method: DELETE
URI Template: /translate/{id}
URI Template Parameter:   
  {id} := ID of a Translation to be deleted
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Success: 200 OK
Failure: 400 Bad Request
Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
```

###### Discover the Translations based on different type of lookups

- Fetch the translation of a specific TD 

```sh
 Method: GET
 URI Template: /translate-lookup
 Request Parameters:
   source := Source TD (Compulsory).
   target := Target TD (Compulsory).
   rt     := Resource (Compulsory).
 Content-Type: application/ld+json
 Success: 200 OK
 Failure: 400 Bad Request
 Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
 ```
 - Fetch all the translations in the dataset
 
```sh
 Method: GET
 URI Template: /translate-lookup
 Request Parameters:
   none
 Content-Type: application/ld+json
 Success: 200 OK
 Failure: 400 Bad Request
 Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
 ```
 
 - Search all the fail translations 
 
 Fail translations are the translations that do not exist into the dataset but an endpoint has requested it at any point in time.

```sh
  Method: GET
  URI Template:  /translate-lookup/fail
  Request Parameters:
    none
  Content-Type: application/ld+json
  Success: 200 OK
  Failure: 400 Bad Request
  Failure: 500 Internal Server Error
 ```
